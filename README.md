# Debug Deaf Grandma

In this exercise, you are provided with a "completed" solution to the deaf grandma challenge. However, it has several bugs that prevent it from working correctly. Fix the bugs in `main.js` so that it produces the correct output. 

To run the program make sure you have the live server extension in VS code. A button on the bottom of the editor will appear with `Go Live`on it. Make sure you're in the exercise directory and hit that button and a browser should show up and if your code is correct you should be able to see a prompt.
